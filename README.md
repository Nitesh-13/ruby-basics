# Ruby Programming Language

Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language that was created in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro Matsumoto in Japan. Ruby is designed to be easy to read and write, and it has a simple and elegant syntax that makes it a popular choice for web development, scripting, and automation.

## Basic Syntax

Here are some basic Ruby syntax concepts:

* Ruby code is executed line-by-line, from top to bottom.
* Statements in Ruby are terminated by a semicolon (;) or by a newline character.
* Ruby variables are dynamically typed, which means you don't have to declare a variable's type before using it.
* Ruby comments begin with a hash symbol (#) and continue to the end of the line.
* Ruby has a number of built-in data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and hashes.
